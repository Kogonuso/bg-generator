This is a lecture on how to use github for source control.

Firstly, let's download and install the git client to our computer, then 
create an empty project on github and call it 'bg-generator'

Next we open folder in our computer and that will be our workspace
then open a commadline terminal and cd to that folder
Example: cd desktop\web-learning-javaScript\git

This will now place the terminal in the workspace directory

You can use the Dir command to list all the files and folders in the current directory

The we will clone the bd-generator project from github using the command:
git clone https://github.com/Kogonuso/bg-generator.git

add files to the cloned project and 
run the command 'git status' to see the untracked files on github

to add the files to the github project on github
run the command add followed by the file name.
 Example:
 git add index.html
 git add style.css
 git add script.js 

 or you can just add all the files and folders in the directory by runnoing the command:
 git add .

git status to see the uncommitted filed

git commit -m "message" to commit the files 

git push to actually push the files into the project in github


=============The above is how to create a project and push it to github=====




Below we talk about how to actually make a pull request:
